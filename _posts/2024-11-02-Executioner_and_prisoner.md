<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our human life in society is very similar to the relationship between an executioner and a prisoner. Each person, driven by their ideals, plays a temporary role both towards themselves and towards their neighbor.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We are executioners because, in reality, and sometimes without meaning to, we want to limit others, interpret their actions, and make them fit into a mold that suits us. By doing so, we become prisoners of our own mold. We suffer because others do not fit into ours, and we suffer even more because we do not fit into theirs. Executioner and prisoner: this is what modern man is.
