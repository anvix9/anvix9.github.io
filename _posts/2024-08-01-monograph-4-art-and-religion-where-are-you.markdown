# Introduction
<br/>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
All along the monographs, we have been discussing important elements that shape Science as we know it today, its roots but also its relationships with scientist. 
We have been talking about the what could be the Philosophy of science from our humble perspective but yet it came to us from the last topic that one main aspect 
which influences Science is still missing, the Art and Religion or could we say Traditions.

In this monograph, we will be sharing how this domain has always influenced Science and its actors (scientists) and provide how scientists go beyond that, to 
bring breakthrough in our society.
