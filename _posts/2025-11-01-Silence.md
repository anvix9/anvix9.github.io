<p style="text-align: justify;">

There are so many ways to worship and love the divine. Through songs, prayers, or other acts of devotion, we draw closer to the Lord. But there are moments when silence itself begins to worship. Emitting even a simple sound petrifies the mind and distracts the heart, destroying the secret ritual that exists in the moment. A ritual of love and intimacy that only silence is capable of understanding.
