# About The collections
<p style="text-align: justify;">

The collections represent a series of shorts texts I write generally all of a sudden, from one words coming in my mind, or something I reflected in the past, 
and the answer comes to me without any great intention or effort. The effort generally comes later, when I have to revise the text, and make it more readable.
But they are just a snippet of my mind, a reflection of my understanding. 

It is not meant to be accepted or to be liked, just shared and kept for whoever wants to read it.
